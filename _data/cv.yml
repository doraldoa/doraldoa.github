    - title: Research on Piezoelectric Nano-Precision Control
      institution: Tsinghua University, Beijing
      year: 2021 -now
      description:
        - Proposed a novel nonlinearity compensation scheme that exhibits a comparative performance to the iterative learning control (ILC) without abundant time consuming off-line iterations or complex hysteresis model while augmenting the robustness to trajectory variations.
        - A two-axis motion platform was built to further optimize the algorithm by taking the contour control error and attempting to further extend it to Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).

    - title: An Ultrafast Low-Grade Coal Upgrade Approach
      institution: Tsinghua University, Beijing
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Proposed an ultrafast process to upgrade a low-grade coal - lignite into conductive porous material and successfully applied to solar-driven water treatment.
        - The process eliminates the complex pre-activation processes in conventional approaches. The whole process takes only 30 s with an ultrafast heating rate exceeding 9000℃/min and a maximum temperature over 1500℃.
        - The final product exhibits remarkable properties. Under 1 sun, its application to solar-driven water treatment brings a significant increase (~8 times) in water evaporation rate than wateritself, while exhibiting over 98.2% removal rate of contaminants.
