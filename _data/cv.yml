    - title: Research on Piezoelectric Nano-Precision Control
      institution: Tsinghua University, Beijing
      year: 2022-now
      description:
        - Proposed a novel nonlinearity compensation scheme that exhibits a comparative performance
          to the iterative learning control (ILC) without abundant time-consuming off-line iterations or
          complex hysteresis modeling while enhancing the robustness to trajectory variations.
        - Two-axis motion platform was built to further optimize the contour control error while attempting further extend related algorithm to Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)..

    - title: Ultrafast Low-Grade Coal Upgrade 
      institution: Tsinghua University, Beijing
      year: 2022-2023
      description:
        - Proposed an ultrafast and environmental-friendly approach for upgrading low-grade coal into conductive nanoporous material and applying it to solar-driven water treatment.
        - The approach eliminates complex pre-activation processes, which takes only 30 s, while the ultrafast heating rate exceeds 9000 ℃/min, with a maximum temperature over 1500 ℃.
        - Under 1 sun, its final product brings a significant increase (∼8 times) in water evaporation rate than pure water, while exhibiting over 98.2% removal rate of contaminants.

      institution: Tsinghua University, Beijing
      year: 2021-2022
      description:
        - Led two graduate students through the design and fabrication of Twisted and Coiled Polymel Fiber (TCPF), a type of artificial muscle made from fish line.
        - A Small Parallel Cable-Driven Robot based on TCPF with an overall dimension of 45 × 50 × 90 mm<sup>3</sup> and a motion space of 20 × 23 × 16 mm<sup>3</sup>, has been controlled by Matlab and dSPACE.
        - This Robot was driven by current and can perform precise tasks, such as micro assembling. The related paper was nominated as Best Paper Finalist in Control by <i><b>IEEE RCAR 2022</b></i>.
