abstract = {Graphene quantum dots decorated zinc oxide nanowires (GQDs@ZnO-NWs) were applied to enhance sensing performance of highly flexible and transparent surface acoustic wave (SAW) ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors made on ultra-thin flexible glass. The developed flexible SAW sensors possess better performance than that of the previously developed polymer based flexible SAW devices, due to insignificant acoustic loss of flexible glass substrate. UV sensitivity of the flexible glass based SAW sensors was enhanced by three times, and the response time was shorten by four times after the sensor was coated with the GQDs@ZnO-NWs hybrid nanomaterials. These improvements are mainly attributed to: (1) large specific surface areas of ZnO NWs which can generate a large number of photon-generated carriers; (2) introduction of GQDs which can reduce the carrier recombination rate. The resonant frequency of flexible glass SAW UV photodetectors exhibited a good repeatability and stability in responses to cyclic changes of the UV lights at different wavelengths. They also maintained a good performance under a bending angle of ∼30° for 200 times without apparent degradation, showing the excellent flexibility and stability of the UV photodetector.}

  abstract={Thanks to the stable and precision control characteristics of parallel cable-driven mechanisms, cable-driven parallel robots have an extremely wide range of industrial applications. These advantages can also be used to describe a millimeter-sized cable-driven parallel mechanism, therefore, we can develop a miniature cable-driven parallel robot to undertake stable and precise processing or operation beneath small scale. In this paper, a cable-driven robot "MicroCable" that operates in millimeter-scale dimensions is introduced, with detailed design and manufacturing process. This $45\times 50\times 90mm$ robot has a total mass of 28g, a payload of $\geq$50g, and an operating accuracy of $\leq$lmm in a working space of $20mm\times 23mm\times 16mm$. It is driven by three 60mm-long artificial muscles with a maximum deformation of $\geq$33% for a single artificial muscle, a payload of $\geq$50g, and a self-weight of only 0. 5g. We have verified the controllability of the cable-driven mechanism with artificial muscles at millimeter dimensions, and look forward to its potential applications in future microassembly, micromedicine, microprinting, etc.},
