abstract = {Graphene quantum dots decorated zinc oxide nanowires (GQDs@ZnO-NWs) were applied to enhance sensing performance of highly flexible and transparent surface acoustic wave (SAW) ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors made on ultra-thin flexible glass. The developed flexible SAW sensors possess better performance than that of the previously developed polymer based flexible SAW devices, due to insignificant acoustic loss of flexible glass substrate. UV sensitivity of the flexible glass based SAW sensors was enhanced by three times, and the response time was shorten by four times after the sensor was coated with the GQDs@ZnO-NWs hybrid nanomaterials. These improvements are mainly attributed to: (1) large specific surface areas of ZnO NWs which can generate a large number of photon-generated carriers; (2) introduction of GQDs which can reduce the carrier recombination rate. The resonant frequency of flexible glass SAW UV photodetectors exhibited a good repeatability and stability in responses to cyclic changes of the UV lights at different wavelengths. They also maintained a good performance under a bending angle of ∼30° for 200 times without apparent degradation, showing the excellent flexibility and stability of the UV photodetector.}

  abstract= {Thanks to the stable and precision control characteristics of parallel cable-driven mechanisms, cable-driven parallel robots have an extremely wide range of industrial applications. These advantages can also be used to describe a millimeter-sized cable-driven parallel mechanism, therefore, we can develop a miniature cable-driven parallel robot to undertake stable and precise processing or operation beneath small scale. In this paper, a cable-driven robot "MicroCable" that operates in millimeter-scale dimensions is introduced, with detailed design and manufacturing process. This 45×50×90mm robot has a total mass of 28g, a payload of ≥50g, and an operating accuracy of ≤1mm in a working space of 20mm×23mm×16mm. It is driven by three 60mm-long artificial muscles with a maximum deformation of ≥33% for a single artificial muscle, a payload of ≥50g, and a self-weight of only 0.5g. We have verified the controllability of the cable-driven mechanism with artificial muscles at millimeter dimensions, and look forward to its potential applications in future microassembly, micromedicine, microprinting, etc.},

  abstract = {Back electromotive force (EMF)-based sensorless control strategies for permanent-magnet linear synchronous motor (PMLSM) have the potential to simplify the mechatronic system, reduce the cost and prolong the service life. However, the poor performance in the low-to-zero speed region limits their application range. In this article, a novel back EMF-based mover position estimator is proposed to achieve consistent good accuracy in the whole speed range including high speed, medium speed, low speeds, temporary standstill, and speed reversals. The three-phase flux linkages are obtained by directly calculating the integration of back EMF. To overcome the curve drift caused by the integrator, this article proposes a jumping correction algorithm and a uniform correction algorithm. The mover position is calculated from the corrected flux linkages. This article also realizes a closed-loop sensorless trajectory tracking control system using the proposed position estimator. Experimental results on a PMLSM demonstrate that the proposed position estimator can guarantee the stability and accuracy in the whole speed range. Compared with the existing back EMF-based methods working only well in high-speed region and usually with mm -level accuracy, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of sub-200 μm regardless of the reference trajectory, and has exciting prospect in industrial applications. },

abstract = {Abstract Refractory metals offer exceptional benefits for high temperature electronics including high-temperature resistance, corrosion resistance and excellent mechanical strength, while their high melting temperature and poor processibility poses challenges to manufacturing. Here this work reports a direct ink writing and tar-mediated laser sintering (DIW-TMLS) technique to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) refractory metal devices for high temperature applications. Metallic inks with high viscosity and enhanced light absorbance are designed by utilizing coal tar as binder. The printed patterns are sintered into oxidation-free porous metallic structures using a low-power (<10 W) laser in ambient environment, and 3D freestanding architectures can be rapidly fabricated by one step. Several applications are presented, including a fractal pattern-based strain gauge, an electrically small antenna (ESA) patterned on a hemisphere, and a wireless temperature sensor that can work up to 350 °C and withstand burning flames. The DIW-TMLS technique paves a viable route for rapid patterning of various metal materials with wide applicability, high flexibility, and 3D conformability, expanding the possibilities of harsh environment sensors.}

abstract = {Lignite, a low-grade coal, accounts for over 40% of the global coal reserves. The use of lignite has been limited compared to other grades due to its low calorific value, high impurities content, and elevated volatile matter. Exploring a scalable and environment-friendly approach to upgrade lignite will offer new opportunities. In this work, Ultrafast High-Temperature Carbonization (UHC) has been developed to carbonize lignite and modify its nanoscale structure to construct a conductive porous membrane. The whole process takes only 30 s with an ultrafast heating rate reaching up to 9000 °C/min and a maximum temperature over 1500 °C. Upon heating the pore structures in the coal membrane evolves into micro- and mesopores with a specific surface area of over 300 m2/g. The carbonized coal-based membrane provides superior performance as a solar evaporator for water treatment, due to its interconnected porous structures, hydrophilicity, and over 85% absorption of full-band visible light. Under 1 sun solar irradiation, the membrane shows over 98.2% removal rate of salts, heavy metal ions, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).}

  abstract = {In the realm of nano-precision piezoelectric systems extensively applied in industrial measuring and manufacturing, addressing the inherent nonlinearities, particularly hysteresis is crucial. In this paper, a nonlinearity compensation strategy that achieves excellent tracking performance has been proposed without the need for a hysteresis model. The approach commences with the establishment of the closed-loop feedback system. Subsequently, a well-designed feedforward Zero Phase Error Tracking Control is introduced, which effectively compensates for tracking errors induced by the reference. Finally, an adaptive compensator is employed to eliminate residual errors, including hysteresis and modeling error. The proposed model-free compensation strategy demonstrates comparable performance to iterative learning control (ILC) without requiring time-consuming off-line iterations while enhancing robustness against trajectory variations. The experimental results consistently validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy for various trajectory-tracking tasks, including the adaptability to mutation trajectories. This model-free strategy can be readily applied without complex modeling or time-consuming iterations, demonstrating its potential for practical industrial applications in nano-precision motion control.}
