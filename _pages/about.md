Hello, everyone! I'm Chih-Chin Liu and I come from the vibrant city of Xiangtan, Hunan. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Tsinghua University, specializing in **Precision Control**. **I am excitedly seeking a suitable Ph.D. position** that aligns with my abilitiy and pursuits. You can find more about me in [My CV](/cv/), [Research Projects and Social Activities](/projects & activities/).

Throughout my academic journey, I have nurtured a profound interest in science and technology. My curiosity has led me to explore various fields, including **Robotics, Flexible Sensors, Machining Learning, and Carbon-Based Materials**. While I have acquired broad knowledge across these disciplines, I also recognize the need to delve deeper into a specific area during my follow doctoral studies. I believe this interdisciplinary approach will empower me to make valuable contributions to my future research, cause it extends my strength lies in having the ability to draw connections and leverage diverse background knowledge.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I am an individual who cherishes traditional culture and embraces a wide range of interests. I have dedicated time to studying **Face-Changing in Sichuan Opera** and have even volunteered for performances in my hometown. During my leisure moments, you'll often find me exploring captivating open-source projects on GitHub and enjoying insightful content on YouTube, or simply marveling at the beauty of the night sky.
